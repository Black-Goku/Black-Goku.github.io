<p>I’m honestly struggling right now to even form words and proper sentences because I can hardly wrap my mind around the fact that our home and my humble little blog was featured in such an amazing magazine. I’ve had a few other small magazine features over the past two years ( <span style="color: green;"> <strong>a photo of my summer porch is in the current issue of the Country Sampler Farmhouse Style edition!</strong></span>) but never a whole spread like this. <span style="color: pink;"><em> EIGHT PAGES</em> </span>of our little cottage. Seriously, someone pinch me because this feels like a dream. It’s beyond surreal and I just feel so incredibly honored and proud to see our humble home and my blog featured in such a cool way.</p>

<p>This weekend I tried to slow down to really process all of this. I wanted to just reflect on how far things have come. Not only with our home and all of the projects we’ve done over the past two years, but with me too. I never could have imagined all of the amazing opportunities that would come my way because of this blog. And to be really honest, I don’t consider myself to be a “designer” that should be gracing the pages of national decor magazines. Not even close actually. In fact, I feel like a total misfit. I have absolutely zero formal training. And I don’t pay attention to any rules or proper lingo when it comes to design. I’m simply making a home for my family and sharing it along the way. But somehow God has brought these incredible opportunities my way. I am just SO grateful and I give Him all the glory.</p>



<p>I can’t help but think back to when our story began with this little 1980’s fixer upper. I can remember the exact moment I walked through the front door for the very first time. I instantly got that tingly magic feeling in the pit of my stomach and I knew this was the one. Fast forward a few months and I was sharing our renovation projects on my brand new blog. It’s crazy to see how much work we’ve put into this place and all that has happened over these past two and a half years. I never could have imagined how this home would bless our lives. And I gotta say, it’s a pretty cool feeling to see our little fixer upper spread across this magazine.</p>

<p>I’m sharing this with you guys today because I want this to inspire you to chase your dreams and follow your heart. I know that sounds cliche and some of you might be rolling your eyes right about now, but TRUST ME. If I can do this, then the sky is the limit for us all. I truly believe that if you’re following your heart and working hard, nothing will stop you. Don’t be afraid to take that first step into the unknown, even if you have no clue what you’re doing. Just show up and give it everything you’ve got.</p>

<p>Thank you all for always having my back and for the constant support and kindness! Really, you are awesome humans. xo</p>
